                        The graduate program of the Department of Computer Science and Information
                        Engineering was established on August 1, 1999. The founding faculty members
                        came from departments such as Electronic Engineering, Electrical
                        Engineering, and Information Management. Afterward, the undergraduate
                        program of the our department was later established on August 2001, with
                        both two-year and four-year undergraduate programs, and the department
                        became one of the members of the College of Electrical Engineering and
                        Computer Science. Since 2001, besides regular Master and Ph.D. programs, the
                        graduate program starts offering part-time Master program in order to reach
                        more tightly connection between the academic and the industry and to provide
                        a talent nurturing environment for the industry.
